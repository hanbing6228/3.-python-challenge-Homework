Py Me Up

## Background

1. Create a new GitHub repo called `python-challenge`. Then, clone it to your computer.

2. Inside your local git repository, create a directory for both of the  Python Challenges. Use folder names corresponding to the challenges: **PyBank** and  **PyPoll**.

3. Inside of each folder that you just created, add a new file called `main.py`. This will be the main script to run for each analysis.

4. Push the above changes to GitHub.
